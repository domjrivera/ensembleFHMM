R package for ensemble MCMC for Factorial Hidden Markov Models

This R package accompanies our paper on "Augmented Ensemble MCMC with applications to Factorial HMMs" [available on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08520). 

It contains implementation for fitting Factorial Hidden Markov Models using C++ backend and exposing this to R via Rcpp modules.
